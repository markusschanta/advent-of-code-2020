    "# Day 23: Crab Cups\n",
    "\n",
    "The small crab challenges you to a game! The crab is going to mix up some cups, and you have to predict where they'll end up.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cups will be arranged in a circle and labeled **clockwise** (your puzzle input). For example, if your labeling were `32415`, there would be five cups in the circle; going clockwise around the circle from the first cup, the cups would be labeled `3`, `2`, `4`, `1`, `5`, and then back to `3` again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the crab starts, it will designate the first cup in your list as the **current cup**. The crab is then going to do **100 moves**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each **move**, the crab does the following actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The crab picks up the **three cups** that are immediately **clockwise** of the **current cup**. They are removed from the circle; cup spacing is adjusted as necessary to maintain the circle.\n",
    "* The crab selects a **destination cup**: the cup with a **label** equal to the **current cup's** label minus one. If this would select one of the cups that was just picked up, the crab will keep subtracting one until it finds a cup that wasn't just picked up. If at any point in this process the value goes below the lowest value on any cup's label, it **wraps around** to the highest value on any cup's label instead.\n",
    "* The crab places the cups it just picked up so that they are **immediately clockwise** of the destination cup. They keep the same order as when they were picked up.\n",
    "* The crab selects a new **current cup**: the cup which is immediately clockwise of the current cup.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose your cup labeling were `389125467`. If the crab were to do merely 10 moves, the following changes would occur:\n",

Starting **after the cup labeled `1`**, collect the other cups' labels clockwise into a single string with no extra characters; each number except `1` should appear exactly once.

In this way, every number from one through one million is used exactly once.\n",
