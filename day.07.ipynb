    "You land at the regional airport in time for your next flight. In fact, it looks like you'll even have time to grab some food: all flights are currently delayed due to **issues in luggage processing.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to recent aviation regulations, many rules (your puzzle input) are being enforced about bags and their contents; bags must be color-coded and must contain specific quantities of other color-coded bags. Apparently, nobody responsible for these regulations considered how long they would take to enforce!\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "    light red bags contain 1 bright white bag, 2 muted yellow bags.\n",
    "    dark orange bags contain 3 bright white bags, 4 muted yellow bags.\n",
    "    bright white bags contain 1 shiny gold bag.\n",
    "    muted yellow bags contain 2 shiny gold bags, 9 faded blue bags.\n",
    "    shiny gold bags contain 1 dark olive bag, 2 vibrant plum bags.\n",
    "    dark olive bags contain 3 faded blue bags, 4 dotted black bags.\n",
    "    vibrant plum bags contain 5 faded blue bags, 6 dotted black bags.\n",
    "    faded blue bags contain no other bags.\n",
    "    dotted black bags contain no other bags.\n",
    "\n",
    "These rules specify the required contents for 9 bag types. In this example, every `faded blue` bag is empty, every `vibrant plum` bag contains 11 bags (5 `faded blue` and 6 `dotted black`), and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a **`shiny gold`** bag. If you wanted to carry it in at least one other bag, how many different bag colors would be valid for the outermost bag? (In other words: how many colors can, eventually, contain at least one `shiny gold` bag?)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above rules, the following options would be available to you:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A `bright white` bag, which can hold your `shiny gold` bag directly.\n",
    "* A `muted yellow` bag, which can hold your `shiny gold` bag directly, plus some other bags.\n",
    "* A `dark orange` bag, which can hold `bright white` and `muted yellow` bags, either of which could then hold your `shiny gold` bag.\n",
    "* A `light red` bag, which can hold `bright white` and `muted yellow` bags, either of which could then hold your `shiny gold` bag.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in this example, the number of bag colors that can eventually contain at least one `shiny gold` bag is **`4`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How many bag colors can eventually contain at least one `shiny gold` bag?** (The list of rules is quite long; make sure you get all of it.)\n",
